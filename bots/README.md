Here's a detailed explanation of how the `CounterBot` works, including the mathematics behind the bidding strategy:

### 1. **Estimating Auction Values (`auction_value_estimate` function)**

The `auction_value_estimate` function calculates the expected value of an auction based on its parameters: the type of die used, the number of dice rolled, and any bonus points.

#### **Mathematical Breakdown:**

- **Inputs**:
  - `die`: The type of die (e.g., a 6-sided die).
  - `num`: The number of dice rolled.
  - `bonus`: Additional points added to the result.

- **Calculation**:
  - The expected value of one die roll is calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Expected value of one die} = \frac{1 + \text{die}}{2}
    \]
  - For example, for a 6-sided die, the expected value is:
    \[
    \frac{1 + 6}{2} = 3.5
    \]
  - The total expected value for multiple dice and a bonus is:
    \[
    \text{Expected value} = \text{num} \times \left(\frac{1 + \text{die}}{2}\right) + \text{bonus}
    \]
  - If `num = 2`, `die = 6`, and `bonus = 3`, the expected value is:
    \[
    2 \times 3.5 + 3 = 10
    \]

### 2. **Estimating OptimalGoldBot's Bids (`estimate_optimal_gold_bot_bid` function)**

This function predicts the bids of the OptimalGoldBot by distributing the total gold proportionally based on the estimated value of each auction.

#### **Mathematical Breakdown:**

- **Inputs**:
  - `auction_estimates`: A dictionary of auction values estimated by `auction_value_estimate`.
  - `total_gold_to_spend`: The total amount of gold OptimalGoldBot is expected to spend.

- **Calculation**:
  - The total estimated value of all auctions is calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Total estimated value} = \sum \text{auction\_estimates.values()}
    \]
  - For each auction, the fraction of the total value determines the bid:
    \[
    \text{Bid fraction} = \frac{\text{estimated\_value}}{\text{total\_estimated\_value}}
    \]
  - The bid amount for each auction is then:
    \[
    \text{Bid amount} = \text{Bid fraction} \times \text{total\_gold\_to\_spend}
    \]
  - The bid amount is rounded down to the nearest integer and must be at least 1 gold.

### 3. **Bot Strategy in `CounterBot` Function**

#### **Maintaining Desired Capital:**

The bot aims to keep a desired capital (`desired_capital = 2800`) to ensure it has enough gold for future rounds, which is set higher than the typical capital maintained by other bots like OptimalGoldBot.

#### **Calculating Available Gold:**

- The bot calculates the amount of gold it is willing to spend this round:
  \[
  \text{Gold to spend} = \max(0, \text{current gold} - \text{desired capital})
  \]
- It caps this amount to avoid overspending:
  \[
  \text{Gold to spend} = \min(\text{Gold to spend}, 4500)
  \]

#### **Estimating OptimalGoldBot's Bids:**

The bot predicts the bids OptimalGoldBot would place using the values calculated earlier. The OptimalGoldBot is estimated to spend up to 4000 gold.

#### **Overbidding Strategy:**

- The bot sorts the auctions by their estimated value, prioritizing the most valuable ones.
- For each auction:
  - It retrieves the estimated bid of the OptimalGoldBot.
  - The bot then overbids the OptimalGoldBot by a certain margin:
    \[
    \text{Overbid amount} = \max\left(\int(\text{OptimalGoldBot bid} \times 1.6), \text{OptimalGoldBot bid} + 200\right)
    \]
  - The bot ensures that it does not bid more gold than it has available:
    \[
    \text{Final bid amount} = \min(\text{Overbid amount}, \text{Gold to spend})
    \]

### **Example Calculation:**

Suppose the bot has 5000 gold and is maintaining a desired capital of 2800. Therefore, it has:
\[
\text{Gold to spend} = 5000 - 2800 = 2200
\]

Assuming OptimalGoldBot is bidding 500 gold on a key auction:
- The bot calculates its overbid:
  \[
  \text{Overbid} = \max\left(\int(500 \times 1.6), 500 + 200\right) = 800
  \]
- The bot places a bid of 800 gold on this auction if it has enough available.

### **Summary of How It Works:**

- The bot strategically maintains high capital, predicts competitor bids, and overbids key auctions.
- Its approach combines auction value estimation with targeted overbidding, maximizing its chances of winning high-value auctions while preserving resources for future rounds.
